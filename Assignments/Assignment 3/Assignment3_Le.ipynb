    "We introduced in Assignment #2 the imporatance of data cleaning and why accurrate data is needed when making informed decisions in our fields. In our assignment, we were faced with making the decision whether or not to omit data we may not know too much about yet.\n",

    "<b>Metadata</b> is data about the data. Metadata can be structural, administrative, statistical and much more.\n",

    "When building your data warehouses it is important to have data cleaning protocols established for your organization BEFORE you start to clean the data.<br><br>\n",

    "-  Enhance your Github account. Add your contact (Stockton) email, your LinkedIn profile, a description, etc. ✅\n",
    "-  Create a Github repository for this class. It can be public or private. If you choose to make it private, add the instructor as a collaborator. @MelissaLaurino ✅<br>\n",
    "-  It is suggested to create your repository using the Git terminal commands. See Blackboard for step by step instructions. ✅\n",
    "-  Staying Connected -> Visit the Discussion Board and share your username with classmates. Follow your classmates on Github. ✅<br>\n",
    "-  Upload Assignment #1, #2, and your clean data (If you created a physical clean copy of it, otherwise the link is fine) to your new/established Github repository. For every repository you create, you'll automatically have the option to include a README.md (Meta data) file. ✅<br>\n",
    "-  Create a descriptive and very detailed README.md file *for your dataset* you have chosen to continue with. Insert a link to your Github README.md repository file in the comments section on Blackboard, or attach this assignment for submission. ✅\n",
