## Dataset description

### Laptop Price Dataset

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asinow/laptop-price-dataset

1. Data Source

This is a synthetic dataset, meaning it was artificially generated by its creator based on real data from major laptop brands such as Dell, Acer, and Apple.

2. Data Collection Method

The author generated 11,768 records. However, the exact method of generation is unknown.

3. Data Extraction Process

The data was generated by code, and all the records were then written into a CSV file.

4. Data Cleaning Program Used

The author provided no information about which program was used to clean the data.

5. Data Cleaning & Transformation Process

- Ensured all prices are within a range and in decimal values (e.g., $300 - $7300).
- RAM values are stored as integers (e.g., "16GB RAM" → 16).
- Verified storage values (e.g., "512GB SSD" or "1TB HDD") to follow consistent formatting.
- Standardized GPU names to match known models (e.g., "NVIDIA RTX 3060", "AMD Radeon RX 6700XT", or "Integrated").
- Ensured screen size, battery life and weight values are within realistic ranges, and in decimal values.
- Standardized resolution to common formats (e.g., "1920x1080", "2560x1440").

6. Units of Numeric Data

- RAM: Gigabytes (GB)
- Storage: Gigabytes (GB) or Terabytes (TB) and types (SSD, HDD)
- Screen Size: Inches
- Resolution: Pixels (Width x Height)
- Battery Life: Hours
- Weight: Kilograms (kg)
- Price: USD ($)

7. Formulas Used in Column Creation

There were no additional column created. If yes, new columns are always added at the end of the table.

8. Data Validation for Consistency

- No negative values for price, RAM, storage, battery life, and weight.
- Resolution data follows a consistent "width x height" format.
- Operating System and processors values match a predefined set of options.
- Ensured that GPU values are realistic and match common laptop models.
